# ECG-Based Authentication Interface Project Report

**Authentication interfaces based on electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained significant attention due to their potential for secure and user-friendly authentication. ECG signals, captured from the heartâ€™s electrical activity, offer unique biometric features that can be leveraged for identity verification.
In this project, we explore the development of an ECG-based authentication system. By analyzing ECG data, extracting relevant features, and employing machine learning classifiers, we aim to create a robust and efficient interface for user authentication.
Stay tuned for further details on our dataset, methodology, implementation, and results!**
